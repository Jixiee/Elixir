# OTP (Open Telecom Platform)
OTP is a set of libraries and design principles for building robust, fault-tolerant, and distributed applications. While it was originally designed for telecom systems, its principles are applicable to a wide range of domains, making it invaluable for any serious Elixir developer.

### What is OTP?
OTP stands for Open Telecom Platform, and it includes a collection of middleware, libraries, and tools for building scalable and maintainable applications. The core components of OTP are:

- **Behaviors:**  Design patterns for implementing common patterns such as servers and state machines.
- **GenServer:** A generic server implementation for handling state and performing synchronous and asynchronous operations.
- **Supervisors:**  Processes that monitor other processes and restart them if they fail.
- **Applications:** A way to package and run components together.
  
### Behaviors
Behaviors are a way to define common patterns in OTP. They provide a set of callback functions that you must implement to conform to the behavior. The most commonly used behaviors are GenServer, Supervisor, and Application.

**1. GenServer:** The GenServer behavior abstracts the common patterns of a server, such as maintaining state and handling requests. It simplifies the process of implementing servers in your application.
```
defmodule MyServer do
  use GenServer

  # Client API

  def start_link(initial_state) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, initial_state, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def get_state do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, :get_state)
  end

  def set_state(new_state) do
    GenServer.cast(__MODULE__, {:set_state, new_state})
  end

  # Server (callbacks)

  @impl true
  def init(initial_state) do
    {:ok, initial_state}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_call(:get_state, _from, state) do
    {:reply, state, state}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_cast({:set_state, new_state}, _state) do
    {:noreply, new_state}
  end
end
```
In this example, MyServer uses the GenServer behavior to implement a simple server that can get and set its state.
