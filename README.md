## Introduction
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. Leveraging the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems, Elixir brings a friendly syntax and a set of tools that makes functional programming approachable and productive.

## Basic Concepts

### Installation
- **Elixir Installation**: Instructions for installing Elixir can be found [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
- **Verify Installation**: Run `elixir -v` in your terminal to verify the installation.

### Basic Syntax
- **Hello World**: Write a simple program to print "Hello, World!".
```elixir
IO.puts "Hello, World!"
```

### Learning Path

Follow the learning path outlined in this repository to build a strong foundation in Elixir. Each section contains detailed notes, code examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding. By the end of this journey, you should be well-equipped to develop robust, scalable, and maintainable applications using Elixir.
