## Introduction
Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. Leveraging the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems, Elixir brings a friendly syntax and a set of tools that makes functional programming approachable and productive.

## Basic Concepts

### Installation
- **Elixir Installation**: Instructions for installing Elixir can be found [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
- **Verify Installation**: Run `elixir -v` in your terminal to verify the installation.

### Basic Syntax
- **Hello World**: Write a simple program to print "Hello, World!".
```elixir
IO.puts "Hello, World!"
